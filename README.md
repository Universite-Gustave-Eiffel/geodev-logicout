# Logicout GeoDev project

This project aims to analyze the deliveries made by agricultural producers 
and to determine which ones can be mutualized among producers in order to 
reduce economic and societal costs.

# Note on data

Data is extracted from the [Logicout platform](https://www.logicout.fr/couts/) for research purposes only. 
They are not open for confidentiality reasons but you can contact the [SPLOTT laboratory](https://splott.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/contacter-le-labo) about them.

4 files are expected in the `data/raw` folder:

- point_arret.csv : departures and delivery points
- simulation.csv : unique simulations entered in the platform
- trajet.csv : trips between two stops
- usage.csv : metadata on the platform usage (for data quality control)
